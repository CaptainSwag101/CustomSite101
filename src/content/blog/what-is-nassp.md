For over two and a half years I've contributed to an open-source addon called "NASSP" for the Orbiter space flight simulator program. This addon simulates the Apollo space program that landed humans on the moon in the 1960s and '70s. That is to say, it adds all the relevant space vehicles, including the Saturn IB, Saturn V, Command and Service Module, Lunar Module, and even the tangentially-related Skylab orbital workshop. Additionally, it includes the necessary logic to compute and fly the historical missions, or even plan one's own custom missions. For the Saturn launch vehicle, the Command and Service Module, and Lunar Module, a vast majority of systems are implemented and functional, acting very similarly to their real-life behavior. This project is intended to be a "study simulation": a simulation that is accurate and realistic enough that it can be used to study and learn about the spacecraft behavior, procedures, and mission profiles in as close to an academic manner as can be done with the information and technology available. We personally consider NASSP to be the single most accurate simulation of the Apollo program that currently exists. It's not perfect, but we strive to make it better every time we work on it. For each vessel, we have whole heaps of code which simulates the inner workings of the various systems and components inside the craft, including but not limited to: environmental control and life support; electrical power generation and distribution; cryogenic, gas, and liquid consumables; thermal control and heating/cooling; propulsion; and guidance, navigation, and computer subsystems. Orbiter, the simulator itself, handles the complex physics and aerodynamics of flight, and provides some help with loading and rendering assets like graphics, but pretty much all other computations and work is done by our code.
